# Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Reviews Using LSTM Model
 


This project implements a sentiment analysis application that classifies IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The application is built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.The Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Reviews Using LSTM project aims to develop an interactive web application that leverages deep learning techniques to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. This project is significant in the context of natural language processing (NLP), where understanding user sentiment can provide valuable insights for businesses, developers, and researchers.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words. In this project, we use an LSTM model trained on IMDb movie reviews to predict the sentiment of user-provided reviews.

About LSTM:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to effectively learn and predict sequences of data. They were introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem, which makes them difficult to train on long sequences.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Predicts whether a movie review is positive or negative
- Utilizes an LSTM model for sentiment classification
